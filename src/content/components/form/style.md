## Structure

Forms are made up of several different components. The order in which these elements are arranged is flexible, but should always follow the spacing guidelines below.

Forms can be one column or two. The width of each column varies based on the content and layout of the design. On mobile, forms can only have one column.

All icons can be found on the [iconography](/style/iconography/library) library page.

| SPACE BETWEEN        | PX | REM  |
|----------------------|----|------|
| Text inputs          | 24 | 1.5  |
| Non-input components | 32 | 2    |
| Columns              | 20 | 1.25 |
